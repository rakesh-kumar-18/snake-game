# snake-game
- It is a basic snake game created using python turtle module.
- After running the program a pop up will shown up asking user which level you want to play, user can enter (easy,medium,hard) level. then game will be started.
- In this game user can control snake using (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT) keys on the keyboard.
- Snake will have to eat the red ball, and increase the score.
- In the project we have also create a txt file to keep out highest score.
- The high score will not erase even if you re run the program untill you delete it manually.
- we have also add basic rule to this program like if snake hit the boundary or it's own body then game will be over.

P.S: My high score is 30 in medium level, see if you can break it ;-).

PLAY THIS GAME AND IF YOU LIKE YOU CAN IMPROVE IT.
